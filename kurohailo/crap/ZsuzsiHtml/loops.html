        <div class="explanation">
            <p>There are two types of loops: 'for loops' and 'while loops'.</p>
            <p>With the for loop we can repeat a section of our code n number of times.</p>
            <p>The while loop is very similar to the for loop, it repeats a piece of code. However, unlike the for loop, the while loop
            will not run n times, but until a defined condition is met. While loops are also the 'go to solution' if you want a piece
            of your code to repeat forever.</p>
